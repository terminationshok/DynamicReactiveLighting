  Dynamic Reactive lighting 
 
 This is controller software for LED Lights. It will be dynamic and react 
 to the environment it's placed in, as well as being network-connected.
 The lights will also increase the utility of lighting by responding to
 the needs of the building occupants. It will do this using a variety
 of sensors and APIs. The entire project will leverage and consist of
 open source software and open hardware.
